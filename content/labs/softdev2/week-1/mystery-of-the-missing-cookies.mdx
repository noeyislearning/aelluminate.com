title: "The Mystery of the Missing Cookies"
---

Imagine you are the owner of a small bakery. You notice that every day, a few cookies go missing from the display case. You’re not sure if some is stealing them, if they’re being misplaced, or if they’re just not setting as we as you thought. So need to figure it out what’s happening.

## Collect data

- You start by keeping a log of how many cookies you bake each day, how many you display, and how many you sell.
- You also note the time of day, the weather, and any special events happening in the area.

## Analyze the data

- You look at your log and notice that on rainy days, fewer cookies are sold, but none go missing.
- On sunny days, more cookies are sold, but few still go missing.
- You also notice that on days when there’s a local festival, cookies sell out quickly, but none go missing.

## Draw conclusions

- Based on your analysis, you conclude that the cookies are not being stolen.
- Instead, you realize that on sunny days, the heat causes the cookies to dry out and crumble, which is why they seem to “disappear”.
- You decide to adjust your backing schedule to bake more cookies on sunny days and less on rainy days.

## Make predictions

- Now that you understand the pattern, you can predict how many cookies you’ll need to bake each day based on the weather forecast.
- You also predict that you’ll have fewer “missing” cookies in the future.

## So what’s data science?

Data science is like solving the mystery of the missing cookies. It’s a field that involves collecting analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions. Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather information from various sources. In the case study, you collected data on cookies sales, weather, and events.
2. **Data Analysis**: Examining the data to find patterns, trends, or anomalies. You analyzed the data to see how weather and event affected cookies sales.
3. **Drawing Conclusions**: Making sense of the patterns you found. You concluded that the cookies weren’t being stolen but were crumbling due to the heat.
4. **Predictions**: Using the insights gained to make future decisions. You predicted how many cookies to bake based on the weather forecast.

## Why is data science important?

Data science important because it helps us to make better by providing evidence-based insights. Whether you’re running a bakery, a business, or a government, understanding data can help you optimize processes, improve products, ad make smarter choices.

## Real-world applications of data science

- **Healthcare**: Predicting which patients are at risk of developing certain diseases.
- **Finance**: Identifying fraudulent transactions.
- **Marketing**: Understanding customer behavior to tailor advertising campaigns.
- **Sports**: Analyzing player performance to improve team strategies.

## Activiy

- **Group Work**: Divide students into small groups (3-4 students per group). Each group will be assigned one field to explore.
- **Fields and Applications**: Provide a list of fields and their corresponding Data Science applications. Each group will research and present their findings.
- **Research**: Each group will research their assigned field and application, focusing on how Data Science is used and its impact.
- **Discussion**: Groups will discuss their findings within their teams and prepare a brief presentation.
- **Presentation**: Each group will present their findings to the class, explaining how Data Science is applied in their assigned field and its significance.


## Conclusion

Data science is all about suing data to solve problems and make predictions. Just like solving the mystery of the missing cookies, data science helps us to understand the world around us and make better decisions. Whether you’re business owner, a scientist, or just curious about how things works, data science can provide valuable insights.
