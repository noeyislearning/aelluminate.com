title: SELECT
---

Imagine you have a magical book that can show you any information you need from a vast library of data. The `SELECT` statement is your magical spell that allows you to fetch this information from your database. It’s like having a key to unlock specific parts of a massive vault of data. Let’s see how it works!

In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to fetch data from a database. Let’s break down a simple example:

```sql
SELECT name FROM celebs;
```

In this statement:

- `SELECT`: This is the clause that signals you're making a query. Every time you want to retrieve data from a database, you start with SELECT.
- `name`: This specifies the column from which you want to retrieve data. In this case, we're interested in the `name` column.
- `FROM celebs`: This specifies the table you're querying. Here, it's the celebs table.

So, this statement asks the database: _"Hey, show me all the data in the name column from the celebs table."_

## Fetching Data from All Columns

But what if you want to see all the information in a table, not just one column? That's where the wildcard character `*` comes in handy. It tells the database, _"Give me everything!"_

```sql
SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

In this case:

- `*` is a special wildcard character that selects every column in the table.
- The result set will include all the columns from the celebs table.

Whenever you run a `SELECT` statement, it returns a new table called the result set. This result set contains the data you've asked for based on your query.

## Activity

Let's put our knowledge into practice with a couple of activities!

### Retrieving Specific Data

Imagine you want to know the names of all the celebrities in your `celebs` table. Here's the SQL command to retrieve this information:

```sql
SELECT name FROM celebs;
```

This will fetch all the names from the `celebs` table. Simple, right? Let’s see what names are in our celebrity database!

| **name** |
| -------- |

| Justine Bieber |
| Beyoncé Knowles |
| Jeremy Lin |
| Taylor Swift |

### Retrieving All Data

Now, let’s try something different. First, delete the previous `SELECT` statement from your code editor. We’re going to use the wildcard character `*` to select all the data from the celebs table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

This command will fetch all the columns and rows in the `celebs` table. Think of it as looking at the entire library rather than just a single book.

| **id** | **name**        | **age** |
| ------ | --------------- | ------- |
| 1      | Justin Bieber   | 29      |
| 2      | Beyoncé Knowles | 42      |
| 3      | Jeremy Lin      | 35      |
| 4      | Taylor Swift    | 33      |
