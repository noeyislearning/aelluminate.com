title: CREATE
---

This statement tells SQL that we want to create a new table with a specified name and defined columns. Let's illustrate this with a practical example by creating a table named `celebs`.

## Example

Creating the `celebs` table, here’s the SQL command to create our `celebs` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER,
   name TEXT,
   age INTEGER
);
```

Let’s break down this statement step-by-step:

1. `CREATE TABLE`: This clause indicates that we are creating a new table.
2. `celebs`: This is the name of our table. It’s where all the celebrity data will be stored.
3. `(id INTEGER, name TEXT, age INTEGER)`: This list specifies the columns in our table and their data types:

   - **id**: The first column, storing INTEGER values, unique identifiers for each celebrity.
   - **name**: The second column, storing TEXT values, representing the names of the celebrities.
   - **age**: The third column, also storing INTEGER values, representing the ages of the celebrities.

## Activity

Now, let's apply what we’ve learned with a hands-on activity. This will help solidify your understanding and get you comfortable with creating tables.

### Let's Confirm the Database is Empty

Before we create our table, we need to ensure the database is empty. Execute the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

This query attempts to select all data from the `celebs` table. Since we haven’t created it yet, the result should indicate that no such table exists. This confirms our database is indeed empty and ready for a new table.

### Create the `celebs` Table

With the confirmation that our database is empty, it’s time to create our new `celebs` table. Type the following command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER,
   name TEXT,
   age INTEGER
);
```

Once you’ve entered this command, hit [[Enter]] to execute it. You’ve just created your first table in SQL! Congratulations!

Here's a visual representation of the query results:

| **name** | **type** |
| -------- | -------- |
| id       | INTEGER  |
| name     | TEXT     |
| age      | INTEGER  |
