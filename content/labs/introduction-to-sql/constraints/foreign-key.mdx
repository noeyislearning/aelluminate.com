title: FOREIGN KEY
---

The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint establishes a relationship between two tables. It ensures that the values in a column (or a group of columns) in one table match the values in a column (or a group of columns) in another table. This constraint is used to enforce referential integrity between tables. For example, consider two tables `orders` and `customers`, where the `orders` table has a column `customer_id` that references the `customer_id` column in the `customers` table. The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint can be applied as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

In this case, the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table must match a `customer_id` value in the `customers` table, ensuring that orders are associated with valid customers.

| **name**        | **type**    |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **customer_id** | INT         |
| first_name      | VARCHAR(50) |
| last_name       | VARCHAR(50) |

| **name**        | **type** |
| --------------- | -------- |
| order_id        | INT      |
| **customer_id** | INT      |
| order_date      | DATE     |

In the table above, the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table references the `customer_id` column in the `customers` table, as required by the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint.
