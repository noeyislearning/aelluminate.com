title: IS NULL
---

In any data journey, you will encounter missing values. These missing values are represented as `NULL` in SQL. But what exactly is `NULL`? `NULL` is used to signify that a value is unknown, absent, or not applicable. It's like a placeholder indicating the absence of data.

- `NULL` is not zero.
- `NULL` is not an empty string.
- `NULL` is simply... NULL!

Let's think of `NULL` as a mystery box in our data tableâ€”it's there, but we don't know what's inside.

## Why `NULL` Matters

Handling `NULL` values is vital because:

1. **Data Accuracy**: Ignoring `NULL`s can lead to incorrect data analysis.
2. **Query Precision**: Knowing how to handle `NULL`s ensures your queries return accurate results.
3. **Database Integrity**: Properly managing `NULL` values maintains the integrity of your database.

So, whether you're filtering data or performing calculations, understanding `NULL`s will make your SQL journey smoother and more precise.

## Working with `NULL` Values

In SQL, we can't use standard comparison operators like `=` or `!=` to test for `NULL` values. Instead, we use the following operators:

1. `IS NULL`
2. `IS NOT NULL`

These operators are designed specifically for working with `NULL` values.

## Activity

Let's dive into an example to see how `IS NOT NULL` and `IS NULL` works in practice.

### Filtering Non-`NULL` Values

Imagine you have a table named `movies` with various columns, including `imdb_rating`. To filter out movies that do have an IMDb rating, you would use:

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT name
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating IS NOT NULL;
```

| **name**        |
| --------------- |
| Avatar          |
| Jurassic World  |
| The Avengers    |
| The Dark Knight |

This query retrieves the names of all movies with a known IMDb rating.

### Filtering `NULL` Values

Now, let's do the opposite. Let's find all the movies that do not have an IMDb rating. This is where we use the `IS NULL` operator. Ready? Here we go!

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT name
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating IS NULL;
```

This query will return the names of all movies with missing IMDb ratings. It's like shining a spotlight on the data we don't have!

| **name**                        |
| ------------------------------- |
| The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |
| Dawn of the Dead                |
| Shawn of the Dead               |
| Star Wars: The Last Jedi        |
