title: DISTINCT
---

When working with databases, especially large ones, it's often necessary to filter out duplicate entries to get a clear picture of the unique data points. This is where `DISTINCT` comes into play. It helps us identify and work with unique values in a dataset, making our analysis cleaner and more precise.

In SQL, the `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return only unique values from a specified column, filtering out all duplicate entries. This can be incredibly useful when you want to understand the variety or range of data within a particular column.

Imagine you have an inventory database that tracks the tools available in a workshop. The table might look something like this:

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT tools
FROM inventory;
```

This query could produce a result like:

| **tools** |
| --------- |
| Hammer    |
| Nails     |
| Nails     |
| Nails     |

As you can see, "Nails" appears multiple times. If we want to know just the unique tools available, we can use `DISTINCT`:

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT DISTINCT tools
FROM inventory;
```

Now, the result would be:

| **tools** |
| --------- |
| Hammer    |
| Nails     |

By using `DISTINCT`, we quickly filter out the duplicates and see that the unique tools in our inventory are "Hammer" and "Nails".

Filtering the results of a query is an essential skill in SQL. It allows you to get a clearer view of your data without having to scan through every single row, which can be especially cumbersome in large datasets.

## Activity

Let's put this into practice with a hands-on activity!

### Identify Unique Genres

Open your SQL editor and type the following query:

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT DISTINCT genre
FROM movies;
```

This query will return a list of unique genres from the `movies` table. Analyzing these unique genres can help you understand the variety of movies available.

| **genre** |
| --------- |
| action    |
| comedy    |
| horror    |
| romance   |
| drama     |
| NULL      |

### Identify Unique Years

Now, let's modify the query to find unique years instead of genres. Change your code to:

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT DISTINCT year
FROM movies;
```

This query will give you a list of unique years in which movies were released, providing a historical perspective on your movie database.

| **year** |
| -------- |
| 2009     |
| 2015     |
| 2012     |
| 2008     |
| 1999     |
| 1997     |
| 2006     |
