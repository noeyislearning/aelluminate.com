title: CHECK
---

The `CHECK` constraint allows you to specify a condition that must be satisfied for the data in a column. This constraint is used to enforce domain integrity by limiting the values that can be inserted into a column. For example, consider a table `employees` with a column `salary` that should be greater than or equal to 0. The `CHECK` constraint can be applied as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary >= 0)
);
```

In this case, the `CHECK` constraint ensures that the `salary` column in the `employees` table contains only values greater than or equal to 0.

| **name**    | **type**       |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| employee_id | INT            |
| first_name  | VARCHAR(50)    |
| last_name   | VARCHAR(50)    |
| salary      | DECIMAL(10, 2) |

In the table above, the `salary` column in the `employees` table is constrained by the `CHECK` constraint to have values greater than or equal to 0.
