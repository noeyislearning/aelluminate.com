title: NOT NULL
---

The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value. This means that every row in the table must have a value for that column. For example, consider a table `employees` with a column `employee_id` that should not be `NULL`. The `NOT NULL` constraint can be applied as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

In this case, the `employee_id` column must have a value for every row in the `employees` table.

| **name**    | **type**    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| employee_id | INT         |
| first_name  | VARCHAR(50) |
| last_name   | VARCHAR(50) |

In the table above, each row has a value for the `employee_id` column, as required by the `NOT NULL` constraint.
