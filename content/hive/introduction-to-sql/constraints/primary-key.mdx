title: PRIMARY KEY
---

The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is a combination of the `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints. It ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value and that all values in the column are unique. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is often used to uniquely identify each row in a table. For example, consider a table `products` with a column `product_id` that should be unique and not `NULL`. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint can be applied as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

In this case, the `product_id` column must have a unique value for every row in the `products` table, and it cannot be `NULL`.

| **name**     | **type**       |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| product_id   | INT            |
| product_name | VARCHAR(50)    |
| price        | DECIMAL(10, 2) |

In the table above, each row has a unique value for the `product_id` column, as required by the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.
