title: UNIQUE

The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same value for that column. For example, consider a table `students` with a column `student_id` that should be unique. The `UNIQUE` constraint can be applied as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT UNIQUE,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

In this case, the `student_id` column must have a unique value for every row in the `students` table.

| **name**   | **type**    |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| student_id | INT         |
| first_name | VARCHAR(50) |
| last_name  | VARCHAR(50) |

In the table above, each row has a unique value for the `student_id` column, as required by the `UNIQUE` constraint.
