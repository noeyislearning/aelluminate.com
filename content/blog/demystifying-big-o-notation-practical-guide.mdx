In the world of computer science, efficiency is paramount. Big O notation provides a standardized way to analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms. This notation focuses on how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm scale as the input size increases. Understanding Big O notation is crucial for developers as it enables them to make informed decisions about algorithm selection and code optimization.

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation simplifies the representation of an algorithm's growth rate by focusing on the dominant terms and ignoring constant factors. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(2n) is simplified to O(n) because both exhibit linear growth. This simplification helps developers grasp the fundamental scaling behavior of an algorithm without getting bogged down by minor details.

## Common Big O Notations

### O(1) - Constant Time Complexity

This notation indicates that the algorithm's runtime remains constant regardless of the input size. Operations like retrieving the first element of an array or using hash maps for lookups typically fall under this category. Constant time complexity is the most efficient and desirable scenario.

```python title="o1.py"
def get_first_element(arr):
    # This operation takes constant time O(1)
    return arr[0]

# Example usage
array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
first_element = get_first_element(array)
print("The first element is:", first_element)
```
<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `get_first_element` takes an array `arr` as input. The size of the array can vary, but the operation performed by the function does not depend on the size of the array.

  - **Operation**: The function simply returns the first element of the array using `arr[0]`. This operation takes a constant amount of time, regardless of how large the array is.

  - **Time Complexity**: Since the time taken by the function does not increase with the size of the input array, the time complexity is O(1), which is constant time.
</Callout>

### O(n) - Linear Time Complexity

Algorithms with linear time complexity exhibit a runtime that grows proportionally to the input size. A simple example is finding the maximum value in an unsorted array, where the algorithm needs to examine each element once.
  
```python title="on.py"
def sum_array_elements(arr):
    total = 0  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    for element in arr:
        total += element  # Add each element to the total
    return total  # Return the total sum

# Example usage
array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total_sum = sum_array_elements(array)
print("The total sum of the array elements is:", total_sum)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `sum_array_elements` takes an array `arr` as input. The time taken by the function increases linearly with the size of the array.

  - **Operation**: The function iterates over each element in the array and adds it to the `total` variable. Since each element is processed once, the time taken grows linearly with the number of elements in the array.

  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(n) because the time taken is directly proportional to the size of the input array.
</Callout>

### O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity

Quadratic time complexity arises when the runtime of an algorithm grows quadratically with the input size. Nested loops are a common cause of quadratic time complexity, as each additional element in the input leads to an exponential increase in the number of operations.

```python title="on2.py"
def find_duplicates(arr):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                duplicates.append(arr[i])
    return duplicates


# Example usage
array = [10, 20, 30, 10, 40, 50, 20]
duplicate_elements = find_duplicates(array)
print("Duplicate elements in the array are:", duplicate_elements)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `find_duplicates` takes an array `arr` as input. The time taken by the function grows quadratically with the size of the array.

  - **Operation**: The function uses nested loops to compare each element in the array with every other element. This leads to a quadratic increase in the number of comparisons as the array size grows.

  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because the number of comparisons grows quadratically with the size of the input array.
</Callout>

### O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity

Algorithms with logarithmic time complexity exhibit a runtime that grows logarithmically with the input size. Binary search is a classic example of an algorithm with logarithmic time complexity, as it halves the search space with each comparison.

```python title="ologn.py"

def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage
array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
target_value = 50
index = binary_search(array, target_value)

if index != -1:
    print(f"Target value {target_value} found at index {index}")
else:
    print(f"Target value {target_value} not found in the array")
```

<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `binary_search` takes a sorted array `arr` and a target value `target` as input. The time taken by the function grows logarithmically with the size of the array.

  - **Operation**: The function performs a binary search on the sorted array to find the target value. At each step, the search space is halved, leading to a logarithmic increase in the number of comparisons.

  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(log n) because the number of comparisons grows logarithmically with the size of the input array.
</Callout>

### O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time Complexity

This notation represents a combination of linear and logarithmic growth. Sorting algorithms like merge sort, which divide the input into smaller chunks and then merge them back together, commonly exhibit this time complexity.


```python title="onlogn.py"
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    left_index = right_index = 0

    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:
            merged.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1

    merged += left[left_index:]
    merged += right[right_index:]

    return merged

# Example usage
array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_array = merge_sort(array)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `merge_sort` takes an array `arr` as input. The time taken by the function grows linearithmically with the size of the array.

  - **Operation**: The function recursively divides the input array into smaller halves until it reaches single-element arrays. It then merges these smaller arrays in sorted order. The merging process involves comparing elements from the two halves, leading to a linearithmic increase in the number of comparisons.

  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) because the number of comparisons grows linearithmically with the size of the input array.
</Callout>

### O(2^n) - Exponential Time Complexity

Algorithms with exponential time complexity exhibit a runtime that doubles with each additional element in the input. Recursive algorithms that generate all possible subsets or permutations of a set often fall under this category.

```python title="o2n.py"
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
n = 6
fibonacci_value = fibonacci(n)
print(f"The Fibonacci value at position {n} is:", fibonacci_value)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `fibonacci` takes an integer `n` as input. The time taken by the function grows exponentially with the value of `n`.

  - **Operation**: The function calculates the Fibonacci value at position `n` using a recursive approach. The recursive calls lead to an exponential increase in the number of function calls and computations.

  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(2^n) because the number of function calls and computations grows exponentially with the input value `n`.
</Callout>

### O(n!) - Factorial Time Complexity

Factorial time complexity represents algorithms whose runtime grows factorially with the input size. Permutations and brute-force algorithms that explore all possible combinations of elements often exhibit this time complexity.

```python title="onfact.py"
def generate_permutations(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return [arr]

    permutations = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        first_element = arr[i]
        remaining_elements = arr[:i] + arr[i + 1:]
        for perm in generate_permutations(remaining_elements):
            permutations.append([first_element] + perm)

    return permutations

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3]
permutations = generate_permutations(array)
print("Permutations of the array:", permutations)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Explanation">
  - **Input Size**: The function `generate_permutations` takes an array `arr` as input. The time taken by the function grows factorially with the size of the array.

  - **Operation**: The function generates all possible permutations of the input array by recursively selecting elements and forming permutations. The number of recursive calls and permutations grows factorially with the size of the input array.

  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is O(n!) because the number of permutations grows factorially with the size of the input array.
</Callout>
