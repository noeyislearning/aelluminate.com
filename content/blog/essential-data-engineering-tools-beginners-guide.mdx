Data engineering is a critical field that lays the groundwork for data analysis and machine learning. Data engineers provide the infrastructure and manage the data used for analysis and model training. This field is highly lucrative, with an average salary of \$150,000 and the potential to earn up to \$500,000 per year.

To get started in data engineering, you'll need to understand the tools used for data orchestration, database management, batch processing, ETL, data transformation, data visualization, and data streaming.

Let's explore some popular tools in each of these categories:

## Data Orchestration

- **Prefect**: This tool helps automate and monitor data pipelines. Prefect features an intuitive dashboard and a user-friendly Python API, making it simple to create and manage workflows. It also allows for result saving, workflow deployment and automation, and run status notifications
